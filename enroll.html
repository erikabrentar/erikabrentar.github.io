                        United Airlines has a membership program, MileagePlus, that thousands of customers enroll in each day. The ask of this project was to review the current enrollment experience and improve the UX/UI to help increase customer enrollment conversion.
                        <br><br>
                        I jumped in on this project from a team member who had left the company, but I treated it as if it was a new project with a fresh start to ensure it provided the best user experience.

                    <br>
                After conducting interviews with the business analyst to confirm my understanding on user need and feedback, I came up with the designs below as the main user path. 
                Some design areas of note include:
                <ul class="ulResearch">
                    <li><strong>Three-step form:</strong> The timeline I had did not allow for me to conduct user research on comparing a single page flow versus a multi-page flow. Instead, I spent multiple hours looking up case studies and articles from those that have already done the study with users. There was an overwhelmingly positive result shown for those who used multi-step form approaches when the form was made up of more than a handful of fields and/or more than one section of information. This approach allows for lighter initial cognitive load on the user while still providing the affordance of knowing how many steps it will take to get to completion. We also are able to more easily see where customer drop-off happens for those who do not complete the form, allowing more data for future iterations.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> The new design provides for a seamless experience no matter if a customer is enrolling via their desktop, tablet, or mobile device.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>User freedom: </strong>Users can easily go back in the form if they realize they made a mistake on a previous step. They also have the freedom to leave at any step, but before they go we will display a reminder that if they leave now they will have to start from the beginning next time.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Error prevention:</strong> Descriptive text helps let the customer know their information needs to match their ID exactly, and I provided additional screens to mirror all inline, page level, and service errors.</li>
                 </ul>
                </p>

                    Since going into production, the MileagePlus enrollment form has seen an 8% increase for desktop and a 10% increase for mobile in customer conversions. 
                    <br><br>
                    Future enhancements are currently TBD - I am continuing to monitor customer drop-off to understand where more iterations may be needed.
