                       United's frequent flyer program, MileagePlus, provides an account space for users to view and manage information related to their travel and account details. This page is highly trafficked and viewed by hundreds of thousands members each day. <br><br> While My Account has been serving as the one-stop shop on responsive web, the user experience was not seamless, as noted by customer Qualtrics and OpinionLab comments. Additionally, mobile app added a new hub page for members called “My United” which serves as an access point to the most important pages for travelers. This pushed the need for the responsive web My Account page to also update to My United, creating consistency between both channels.

However, it was clear each page surfaced their most important details for a user first and prominently on the account pages. Those with a home-base experience used their landing page as a summary screen with high-level overview for a user to scan and find what they would like to view or manage. </li>

                    From my analysis, I went through multiple iterations of design. After a series of design reviews with both my leaders and peers, I narrowed in on a general layout that I then refined.

                    I focused on a modular system that surfaced important information and provided multiple paths a user can take to get to their endpoint depending on their preference of scanning summary information or using a side-navigation bar to find details.

                    I created a prototype in InVision with the high-fidelity designs to perform unmoderated usability testing.   
                    My high-level research questions were:

A few research participants noted how trips is higher priority to them, and one specifically called out how they would expect Trips to be higher in the nav. This was an easy adjustment that provided value with changing prior to release. </li>
