                        Any account updates, travel requests, notifications, and payment methods all can be found in the user’s profile section of My Account. The previous experience was housed on legacy code, and it had over 80 different pages for the user to be bumped around to when making changes. Many of the experiences were broken or had outdated information.

                <p class="resultParagraph">
                    We released in December 2020 with Upgrade Trip pages (responsive web) and My Account pages (responsive web and mobile app). We included helper modals on the Upgrade Trip and My Account landing page upon first viewing to educate users on the new PlusPoints product. Within the first week, we saw an increase in flight upgrade traffic by 116%. Users liked having the new ability to waitlist for multiple PlusPoints upgrades. They also liked the ability to choose their upgrade type by line of flight, allowing users to mix money, miles, and PlusPoints on the reservation when previously they could not. Activity clearly displayed for viewing with the updated PlusPoints line items.
