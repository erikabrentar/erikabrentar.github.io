                        The United Airlines loyalty program, MileagePlus, is split between two main sections – general members and Premier members. Premier members get extra benefits for being loyal to United, and the benefits increase as your status increases. Before 2020, Premier members would reach each status level through premier qualifying miles, dollars, and segments that are earned through flight and ancillary purchases.

                        <br>
                        The Loyalty team stakeholders revamped the Premier program starting in 2020 to have new value-based qualifiers for member status, resulting in a need to redesign My Account experience for United’s responsive web and mobile app.

                    We released in January 2020 with both responsive web and mobile app. We included a welcome modal explaining the new value-based qualifications and experience in My Account. This new design provided a much cleaner look to the My Account landing page and created a more seamless experience. Previously some sections were at half page width and with various background colors. The UX was updated to have all sections at full width for easier eye movement down the page. Outside of the main need with redesigning the experience to have value-based qualifications, we also added stakeholder wants, like the benefits section, and customer needs, like the receipts section. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the future iterations, we would like to bring a new status tracking experience into the responsive web My Account landing page that is similar to the tracking dial experience mobile app has. This way users can have a visual of how close they are until their next status level which may help influence them to fly more.
