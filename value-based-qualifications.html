                        The United Airlines loyalty program, MileagePlus, is split between two main sections – general members and Premier members. Premier members get extra benefits for being loyal to United, and the benefits increase as your status increases. Before 2020, Premier members would reach each status level through premier qualifying miles, dollars, and segments that are earned through flight and ancillary purchases.

                        <br>
                        The Loyalty team stakeholders revamped the Premier program starting in 2020 to have new value-based qualifiers for member status, resulting in a need to redesign My Account experience for United’s responsive web and mobile app.

                <!-- <p class="resultParagraph">
                    We released phase 1 in January 2020 which allowed for users to transfer using old and new premier qualifiers depending on the year they were transferring to. The UX experience allowed for an easy transition in May 2020 for our phase 2 release where we sunset the old premier qualifier flex transfer experience. Loyalty stakeholders were excited to see the updates to the look and feel of the flex flow for customers, and digital stakeholders were happy to have the flow moved to the new React platform.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the second release, we also made the flow dynamic to account for future years automatically without needing to go into the codebase.
