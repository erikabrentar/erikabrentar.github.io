                        We were presented with a need for a new integrated experience via mobile app for the ongoing experience of our choosing. When researching options, I saw a gap for the Chicago Botanic Garden. While they had a website, they did not have a mobile app. Many museums and gardens are moving toward interactive app experiences that provide user involvement before, during, and after their visit. 
                        The app would educate visitors and direct them through the park with interactive self-guided tours that can be selected through the application. It would also provide aspects of augmented reality with selected exhibits.
                        <br><br>
                        I took a lead role with my group and guided them throughout the process for our discovery, ideation, and design. We gathered initial data through user interviews and compiled the data into an affinity diagram that supported our user flow and wireframes. These wireframes were then used in a prototype for usability testing. 
                        <br><br>
                        After our delivery of our project, I went through and did a new iteration on the design, adding in UI styling elements.

                Subjects were selected based on if they have ever been to the botanical garden or if they have any interest in visiting the botanical garden. If they have an interest in visiting a botanical garden but have never been to one, then they needed to have been to some sort of museum or exhibit to see how they generally would interact in an exhibit setting. We looked to have a variety of ages and genders to make sure there were multiple demographics represented.

                        Users were given time to do the card sort on their own. After completing the card sort, I asked leading questions to have them describe why they placed certain items into specific categories. Also, I questioned them when they had confusion. The majority were confused on what was meant by “Email” - some believed it to be the user’s email and placed it in Profile, while others thought it was the garden’s email and put it in “Contact us”. This allowed for some discussion on clarifying certain parts of the card sort. One person suggested an “About the garden” section that encompassed details on the garden that had been lumped into a few categories. Another suggestion was “Planning your visit” where many aspects about the before and during could be housed that may not make sense to be a main nav link.

                <p class="researchParagraph">
                    Based on the information collected as I defined the problems being solved for, I was able to create mid-fidelity wireframes for the Chicago Botanic Garden app concept. These wireframes showcase the many features of the app. Two main themes from the affinity diagram were that our users wanted help navigating around the garden, but they also wanted the freedom to roam at their own speed. The app meets these needs by providing a map of the garden that uses geolocation technology to pinpoint the user’s current location. Users can use the QR code scan feature to look up plants they want to learn more about without the need for a guided tour.

                    <p class="researchParagraph">
                        Prior to creating the hi-fi design, I created the style guide for our product. I reviewed the mood board to pull ideas on creating the color palette. Blue and cool colors stood out in our analysis on creating feelings of peace, trust, and protection, so I focused our primary and secondary colors around a monochromatic blue-green color scheme. I chose Aileron as our brand text because it is a very simple font - our goal is to keep the app simple and clutter-free. 
                        <br><br>
                        The logo also implements our brand color and font. The main logo consists of the "Clean Paths" name and blue dot in the center. The blue dot is meant to look like the actual clean paths product that is round in shape. It also symbolizes purity with the lines coming off the dot imply the cleanliness radiating out from the product. The logo is scalable with it being able to just be the blue dot when in an app icon.

                <p class="researchParagraph">
                    Our project scope did not call for high-fidelity designs to be created; however, as a personal project I started mapping out the design concept. The green is the Chicago Botanic Garden’s current brand color, so for the app I created 4 different shades of the lime green to be used throughout. 
                    <br><br>
                    Besides creating a basic style guide, I looked back at the feedback received from the usability tests that were conducted. One main spot of confusion was around the QR code scanner both in terms of what it does and the placement. I moved the scanner to the landing page as was suggested, and I also renamed it to “Plant info scanner” to provide some context to its use.

                    I never feel like a project is complete, and with this one I feel there is much more to explore. I’d like to see another iteration done with the design to complete the high-fidelity screens and have them tested once more. The QR scanner confusion was not the only point of feedback received from the first usability test, so I feel more iterations could be done based on the data that was received.
