                        The current climate has brought to light how necessary it is to make sure viruses and bacteria do not enter our living spaces. While there have been quick solutions to better assist with cleaning, the technology currently available for the general public with sanitation has been limited to small UV sterilization boxes and stationary air purifiers. 
                        <br><br>
                        My partner and I designed a product that solutions for home sanitation using technology. Our conceptual project designs for a dynamically moving air purifier that is controlled by mobile app.

                        We gathered initial feedback with preliminary qualitative surveys. After our first design iteration, conducted usability tests to gather feedback for further design iterations.

                        <li>Consistency between products - Since our product involved both an app and physical, dynamically moving technology, there should be consistency between both in their designs. The user should easily identify that both designs go together.</li>

                    We explored a variety of different ideas centered around home-based purification: food cleanliness, mask technology, and home purification were all initial ideas. Ultimately, we felt home sanitation was most important from a holistic viewpoint. </p>

                   <p class="researchParagraph">For our initial research, I created a survey to gauge participants’ current reactions to a home sanitation product and where they envision improvements. Participants were provided an introduction to the product concept prior to answering the questions. 9 participants of various ages, genders, and backgrounds completed the survey. We compiled user responses in a spreadsheet, and the results were as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="ulResearch">
                        <li>Average age target: 45-54</li>
                        <li>Product concept fostered an idea of protection, safety, and peace of mind - all the feelings we want to carry into our branding </li>
                        <li><strong>8 out of 9 participants</strong> had a reaction of "good," "very good," or "excellent" when it came to how they felt about the described product</li>
                        <li>There were questions on if a machine that was moving would purify or degrade the quality
                        </li>
                        <li>Potential feature ideas: Noise reduction, pre-programming tasks, and drone capabilities</li>
                        <li>Some confusion regarding if it is an air purifier, UV cleaner, or both - we will focus on this in our design consideration</li>

                    With our survey information, we gathered images for to create a mood board. Many participants mentioned “protection,” “safety,” and “peace of mind” as all reasons they would be interested in a dynamic home sanitation product. Cool colors are associated with empathy, protection and clarity, while warm colors suggest more confidence. 
                    <br><br>
                    When comparing with other virus protection images, I noticed many similar color palettes of blue, green, yellow, and orange. These colors helped in guiding our UI design direction.

                <h4 class="UXH4">Mid-fi wireframes</h4>
                <p class="researchParagraph">
                       I used the initial pen and paper sketch drawings to design my wireframes in Sketch for the app concept. When working through my wireframe design, I like to think through my hierarchy on the page. I created sections for the landing page to allow for a user to easily scan through the main options, since it is a central location for the user. I debated between the charging and cleaning placements. While I could see the cleaning section as important on the page hierarchy, ultimately, I felt that the device’s charge level was more important to the user. Once they know if it is charged, then they take the next step in selecting the cleaning option. 
                       <br><br>
                        Users have the option on the landing page to start their clean now or schedule a cleaning cycle for a later time. This follows the design principle of allowing the user to choose their own experience while still providing guidance. 
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, the activity section takes users to a full view of all previous cleaning activity. This feature alleviates the need for users remember previous cleaning dates by having the app track this for them.

                    <p class="researchParagraph">
                        Prior to creating the hi-fi design, I created the style guide for our product. I reviewed the mood board to pull ideas on creating the color palette. Blue and cool colors stood out in our analysis on creating feelings of peace, trust, and protection, so I focused our primary and secondary colors around a monochromatic blue-green color scheme. I chose Aileron as our brand text because it is a very simple font - our goal is to keep the app simple and clutter-free. 
                        <br><br>
                        The logo also implements our brand color and font. The main logo consists of the "Clean Paths" name and blue dot in the center. The blue dot is meant to look like the actual clean paths product that is round in shape. It also symbolizes purity with the lines coming off the dot imply the cleanliness radiating out from the product. The logo is scalable with it being able to just be the blue dot when in an app icon.

                <p class="researchParagraph">
                       I was able to expand upon my mid-fidelity wireframes to create the high-fidelity design. I used the style guide to designate colors for primary and secondary CTAs, descriptive text, headings, and background. All page hierarchy was carried over to the hi-fi designs from the mid-fi wireframes.

                    Due to timing constraints, we kept our usability test very general. We worked to make sure we at least could get some feedback on how participants felt regarding the product to ensure we at least were on the right track. We did an unmoderated usability test with a prompt followed by usability based questions. The following prompt was provided to participants:
                    <br><br>
                    "You have just gone shopping during COVD19 times and enter through the door. You have bags of groceries in your arms, the dog is running around the house, and the phone is ringing. You miss your regular progressive process of cleaning everything before it enters your home. You have just bought the Clean Paths disinfecting machine and have downloaded the compatible app. Clean Paths is a dynamically moving machine that can use UV, Ozone, or HEPA to sanitize the home - the user has the option to choose whichever disinfectant method they prefer to use."
                    <br><br>
                    Participants then clicked through the prototype made with my high-fidelity designs and provided their feedback via a Google form.

                    After reviewing our results from our usability testing, we decided to leave our high-fidelity design as is for our delivery of the project. Many of the responses reflected more on the physical product design than the app design. Comments on the app functionality were for the majority positive. 
                    <br><br>
                    That being said, we were limited in the amount of participants (N=4) who took our usability test. Another usability user test may warrant a need for more iteration on the app design.
                    <br><br>
                    COVID-19 quickly increased the need for us to be thinking in a more safety-oriented mindset focusing on sanitation. We need to find ways to leverage technology in ways that can help as our Clean Paths product does.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving forward, our usability test received many good suggestions from our participants. My teammate and I initially envisioned this product being used in homes, but participants noted that this may be a good product for medical, public buildings, and after having guests over. They also mentioned having the ability to do more than just floors. We see future iterations expanding for more commercial use, as well as the possibility of expanding in height for different surfaces.
