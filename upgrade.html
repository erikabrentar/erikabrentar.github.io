                        In the United Airlines loyalty program, MileagePlus, the top Premier members earn a limited amount of upgrade credits upon reaching status to be used to upgrade their travel. Before 2020, these Premier members would earn Regional Premier Upgrades for domestic travel and Global Premier Upgrades for international travel. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Loyalty team stakeholders received years of feedback from Premier members looking for a change, so they developed a new way for customers to upgrade called PlusPoints. PlusPoints would still be earned at reaching certain Premier status levels, but they could be used for any type of travel. Users also have the ability to upgrade with miles or money.

                <p class="resultParagraph">
                    We released in December 2019 with Upgrade Trip pages (responsive web) and My Account pages (responsive web and mobile app). We included helper modals on the Upgrade Trip and My Account landing page upon first viewing to educate users on the new PlusPoints product. Within the first week, we saw an increase in flight upgrade traffic by 116%. Users liked having the new ability to waitlist for multiple PlusPoints upgrades. They also liked the ability to choose their upgrade type by line of flight, allowing users to mix money, miles, and PlusPoints on the reservation when previously they could not. Activity clearly displayed for viewing with the updated PlusPoints line items.
