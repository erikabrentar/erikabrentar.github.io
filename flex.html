                        There are a select group of United Airlines loyalty members that receive the benefit of Flexible Premier Credit based on the credit card they hold. This flexible credit can be used to help achieve Premier status for the next year, or for a select few months at the beginning of the year members can choose to have their credit apply for current year status. Members like that this special program allows them the flexibility to choose.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The loyalty stakeholders redesigned the Premier program starting in 2020 to have different qualifiers for member status, resulting in a need to redesign the flexible credit transfer experience. This flow was housed on an old codebase, so a replatform and redesign were both needed. This project was broken into two phases for flexible credit:
                        <ul class="ulFlex">
                            <li>Phase 1: Account for both 2019 and 2020 premier qualifiers depending if the user was transferring to past or current year. This had a 3 month scope.</li>
                            <li>Phase 2: Sunset 2019 premier qualifiers and only account for 2020 qualifiers in the flexible credit flow. This had a 2 month scope. </li>  
                        </ul>

                    We released phase 1 in January 2020 which allowed for users to transfer using old and new premier qualifiers depending on the year they were transferring to. The UX experience allowed for an easy transition in May 2020 for our phase 2 release where we sunset the old premier qualifier flex transfer experience. Loyalty stakeholders were excited to see the updates to the look and feel of the flex flow for customers, and digital stakeholders were happy to have the flow moved to the new React platform.

                    <br>
                    In the second release, we also made the flow dynamic to account for future years automatically without needing to go into the codebase.
